autonumber

user -> hotkey: press ctrl+cmd+alt+up
hotkey -> media: sendMediaKeyEvent("SOUND_UP")
media -> eventtap: newSystemKeyEvent(action=true)
eventtap --> media: key down posted
media -> eventtap: newSystemKeyEvent(action=false) delayed
media -> notification: announce("media.volume", payload)
notification -> alert: hs.alert.show(...) (default channel)
alert --> user: toast displayed once (config-driven)

note right of media
`hotkey_utils.bind` stamps descriptions into the log while binding without the
default overlay, preventing the built-in hs.hotkey toast from appearing.
end note
