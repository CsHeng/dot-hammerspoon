title Media controls hotkey (volume up) flow

actor User as user
participant "hs.hotkey" as hotkey
participant "modules.media_controls" as media
participant "hs.eventtap" as eventtap
participant "utils.notification_utils" as notification
participant "hs.alert" as alert

autonumber

user -> hotkey: press ctrl+cmd+alt+up
hotkey -> media: sendMediaKeyEvent("SOUND_UP")
media -> eventtap: newSystemKeyEvent(action=true)
eventtap --> media: key down posted
media -> eventtap: newSystemKeyEvent(action=false) delayed
media -> notification: sendAlert("Media: SOUND_UP", 0.5)
notification -> alert: hs.alert.show(...)
alert --> user: toast displayed once

note right of media
Handler no longer passes a description string to hs.hotkey.bind,
so only notification_utils triggers user feedback.
end note
